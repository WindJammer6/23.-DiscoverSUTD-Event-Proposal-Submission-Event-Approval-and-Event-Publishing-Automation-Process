# SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process
This Github repository is mainly for the planning committee and Office of Student Activities (OSA) of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)'s DiscoverSUTD, an annual event of SUTD that spans for the first 4 weeks after every matriculation day each year for new SUTD students to the school (who are also termed as 'freshies'). The goal of this Github repository is to document on how to use this DiscoverSUTD event proposal submission, event approval and event publishing, automation process, created by me ([Goh Jet Wei's Github account](https://github.com/WindJammer6)), for future year's planning committee of SUTD DiscoverSUTD to use to significantly reduce the amount of administrative work during the planning process of future DiscoverSUTD events.

This SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process is currently deployed and is running.

The SUTD's DiscoverSUTD event consists of a series of mandatory events organised by SUTD school leaders and introductory sessions organised by clubs and 
interest groups in SUTD that 'freshies' can sign up and participate in.

As part of the DiscoverSUTD planning committee in 2024, I have created this DiscoverSUTD automation process using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (a software
that allows developers to automate workflows) that aims to automate the process of event proposal submissions by clubs and interest groups, event approval 
by the SUTD'S Office of Student Activities (OSA), and event publishing to the general SUTD student body.

<br>

## Why this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process helps?
Prior to my batch of DiscoverSUTD planning committee in 2024, there was no existing automation process for the event proposal submissions by clubs and interest groups, event approval 
by the SUTD'S Office of Student Activities (OSA), and event publishing to the general SUTD student body, making the planning process for past DiscoverSUTD events a very manual process, such as:  
1. Getting event proposal submissions form from clubs and interest groups via [Tally form](https://tally.so/)
2. Manually inputting the event details into [Google sheets](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_sg/products/sheets/) for the OSA to approve/disapprove
3. Manually inputting the details of the approved events into a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) calender to publish the approved event details to the general SUTD student body

But with this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), this entire process becomes automated that requires minimal manual work, that requires just 1 SUTD's DiscoverSUTD planning committee member to manage!

## Here's how to use the SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process, step by step:  

video demo here


- Step 1: Send a mass email to the SUTD interest groups and clubs, with this [DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission by clubs and interest groups Tally form](https://tally.so/r/n9qB0E) link  
  <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._p_mtE51iPbuFkDKjzL3oQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180" width="50" height="50">

- Step 2: Whenever a SUTD interest groups and clubs submit an event proposal, the event details will be automatically added to the 'All Events' sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA]()  
<img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._p_mtE51iPbuFkDKjzL3oQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180" width="50" height="50"> -> <img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hBfU2YnPnuc/WimJErMCwKI/AAAAAAAADrg/sWP4nS1jSB0toeYCa0KXSsfuFal1ZMgGQCLcBGAs/s1600/google-sheets-icon.png" width="50" height="50">

- Step 3: (To be done by SUTD OSA) There is a column in the 'All Events' sheet in the  [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), with the header 'Approved/Not approved', which SUTD OSA will select either the option 'Approved' or 'Not approved' after vetting through the event proposal details. There is also another column in the 'All Events' sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA]() with the header 'Reason (if Not Approved)', which SUTD OSA can put a reasoning for not approving a particular event proposal.

- Step 4: (To be done by a DiscoverSUTD planning committee member) Once OSA has finished vetting through all the event proposals in the 'All Events' sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), a DiscoverSUTD planning committee member will need to manually transfer the event details of the approved events to the other 'Approved Events' sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA]().

  **IMPORTANT NOTES FOR STEP 4:**
  - Zapier is designed to detect new rows in Google Sheets, but it's important to understand that Zapier detects new rows based on their addition to the sheet, not on their content. Deleting and re-entering data in the same row won't trigger the automation process because Zapier tracks rows by their unique IDs, which don't change when you modify the content. BASICALLY, PLEASE DO NOT DELETE ANY ROWS ONCE IT IS ADDED INTO THE GOOGLE SHEETS! YOU CAN JUST ERASE THAT UPLOADED EVENT IN THE [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body](https://www.notion.so/discoversutd/DSUTD2024-8b5b48bb985b4e9abf1979ca635ea890) AS DELETING AND RE-ENTERING DATA IN THE SAME ROW WON'T TRIGGER THE AUTOMATION PROCESS!

  - ALSO, PLEASE BE VERY SURE WHEN YOU ADD AN APPROVED EVENT IN THE 'APPROVED EVENTS' SHEET AS ONCE THE EVENT DETAILS OF AN APPROVED EVENT IS ADDED, ITS DETAILS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED TO THE NOTION CALENDER (ITS A NON REVERSIBLE PROCESS, AND YOU MIGHT NEED TO MODIFY THAT APPROVED EVENT MANUALLY IN THE [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body](https://www.notion.so/discoversutd/DSUTD2024-8b5b48bb985b4e9abf1979ca635ea890) LINK IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY CHANGES!

- Step 5: Once the event details of the approved events are transferred to the 'Approved Events sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), the event details (including the date, time, location, sign up form, etc.) will be automatically updated to this [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body](https://www.notion.so/discoversutd/DSUTD2024-8b5b48bb985b4e9abf1979ca635ea890) link (this uploading process might take 3 to 15 minutes)

- Step 6: Send another mass email to the general SUTD student body, with this [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body](https://www.notion.so/discoversutd/DSUTD2024-8b5b48bb985b4e9abf1979ca635ea890) link  
  [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=notion)](https://skillicons.dev) 

- Step 7: Once DiscoverSUTD is over, please remember to erase all the data in the 'All Events' sheet of the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), and the [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body](https://www.notion.so/discoversutd/DSUTD2024-8b5b48bb985b4e9abf1979ca635ea890)'s database **(Please leave the 'Approved Events' sheet of the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA]() as it is!!)**. This step is to reset the entire DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process for the next year of DiscoverSUTD planning committee to use!

  You may choose to make a copy of the 2 sheets of the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), and the [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body](https://www.notion.so/discoversutd/DSUTD2024-8b5b48bb985b4e9abf1979ca635ea890)'s database if you wish to save a copy. But remember not to modify the original 2 sheets of the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), and the [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body](https://www.notion.so/discoversutd/DSUTD2024-8b5b48bb985b4e9abf1979ca635ea890)'s database or it may mess up the entire automation process!

If there is any queries on this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process, feel free to reach out to me :)

<br>

I was using the Zapier free plan (didn't want to pay for it), which has the following plan:  
(I did run into problems of Zapier exceeding the limit and cause some of rhe event proposals to not be submitted and had to do it manually myself... what a nightmare... so make sure you keep track! and this automated process will only work if there is less than a 100 actions per month!)

Zapier's run limits vary depending on the subscription plan you have. As of my last update:

- **Free Plan**: 100 tasks per month
- **Starter Plan**: 750 tasks per month
- **Professional Plan**: 2,000 tasks per month
- **Team Plan**: 50,000 tasks per month
- **Company Plan**: 100,000 tasks per month

These limits are subject to change, so I recommend checking Zapier's official website for the most up-to-date information. 

Luckily, even with the free plan it resets every month, so when I exceeded the number of actions per month I just had to keep manually updating until the next update where I got 100 more free actions and the automation process worked again...

rmb to 'lock' the database somehow after it's done? to prevent anyone from messing with it especially the column headers?
